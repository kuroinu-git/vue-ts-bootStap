                        The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things
                        to say on the subject of towels. A towel, it says, is
                        about the most massivelyuseful thing an interstellar
                        hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical
                        value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you
                        bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
                        on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of
                        Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can
                        sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on
                        the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini
                        raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in
                        hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off
                        noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous
                        Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid
                        animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
                        see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can
                        wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and
                        of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to
                        be clean enough. More importantly, a towel has immense
                        psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag:
                        non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his
                        towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is
                        also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap,
                        tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string,
                        gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc.
                        Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch
                        hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch
                        hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag
                        will think is that any man who can hitch the length and
                        breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle
                        against terrible odds, win through, and still knows

                        The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things
                        to say on the subject of towels. A towel, it says, is
                        about the most massivelyuseful thing an interstellar
                        hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical
                        value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you
                        bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
                        on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of
                        Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can
                        sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on
                        the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini
                        raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in
                        hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off
                        noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous
                        Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid
                        animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
                        see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can
                        wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and
                        of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to
                        be clean enough. More importantly, a towel has immense
                        psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag:
                        non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his
                        towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is
                        also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap,
                        tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string,
                        gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc.
                        Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch
                        hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch
                        hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag
                        will think is that any man who can hitch the length and
                        breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle
                        against terrible odds, win through, and still knows
                        where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
